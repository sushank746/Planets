        <p id="para">Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by<br>
            far, the largest planet in the solar system- more<br> than the twice as massive as all the other planets<br> 
            combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually<br>
            cold, windy clouds of ammonia  and water , floating<br> 
            in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.<br>

        <p id="dept">Jupiter's environment is probably not conductive to life <br>as we know it. The temperature, pressure and <br>materials that characterize this planet are most likely<br>too extreme and volatilenfor organism to adapt to.</p>
        <br>

        <p id="docs">While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living<br>things to take hold, the same is not true of some of <br>its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places<br> to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is <br>evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust,<br> where life could possibly be supported.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="ddoc">The temperature in the clouds of Jupiter is about <br>minus 145 degrees Celsius (minus 234 degrees <br>Fahrenheit). Th. The core temperature may be about <br>24,000 degrees Celsius (43,000 degrees Fahrenheit).<br> That's hotter than the surface of the sun!</p>

The<br> most recent moons were discovered in 2011. The planet's<br>four largest moons are Ganymede (GAN-i-meed), Callisto<br>(kuh-LIS-toe), lo (eye-OH), and Europa (yur-O-puh).</p>
